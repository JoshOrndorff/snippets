openings,"/cname, you demonstrated a firm understanding of the material we covered. You worked hard on all class assignments and it paid off.",You demonstrated understanding of course material and built upon what we learned in class in many interesting ways throughout the course.,You understood and applied all engineering concepts well throughout the course.,"The engineering concepts that we discussed in class piqued your interest, and you demonstrated a thorough understanding of the theory as well as its useful applications.",
,,,,,
progression,"You quickly understood new concepts and began thinking critically about how to apply them to assigned problems, and your own circuit designs.","While you sometimes initially struggled with the more difficult concepts, you always thought carefully about problems, and consequently achieved success.","The material we covered in class was often initially difficult to understand, but your sustained efforts led you to fully understand the concepts.","While some concepts in the class required persistence, you always thought carefully about your work, and consequently achieved success.","Even on the more difficult problem sets such as the transistor problems, your work was meticulous and the answers to problems precise."
,,,,,
filler,"On nightly problem assignments, you used concepts from class and our readings to analyze circuits and further understand the finer points of electronics.","You approached our course content thoughtfully. Through collaboration with your peers and your own insights, you were able to apply even the more difficult concepts correctly.",,,
