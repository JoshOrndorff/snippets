opening,"Your attention to detail, especially during labs, greatly enhanced your academic performance. In the laboratory you successfully assembled and analyzed several experimental circuits, many of which you designed yourself.",
,,
examples,"For example, you were able to make a DC brush motor, as well as an LED flasher based on Relays. You learned quickly that circuits don't always work as expected on the first try and adopted a persistent attitude that allowed you to remain focused until your circuits finally worked. ","For example, you were able to make a DC brush motor, as well as an audio amplifier based on the LM386 integrated circuit."
